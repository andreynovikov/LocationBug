Companion application for <b>Androzic Location Sharing Plugin</b> which enables sending locations in real time. It is small and works in background. It does not have any user interface to see other users in a sharing session nor it consumes any traffic to get that data. Thus it is useful if you only want to broadcast your current location to other users in real time.

Locations are stored on a dedicated server so your device must provide data connectivity (e.g. GPRS or Wi-Fi).

All locations are stored on server for 24 hours (cleaned hourly).
