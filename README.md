Location Bug
============

Companion application for Androzic Location Sharing Plugin which
enables sending locations in real time through GPRS or other
network. It is small and works in background. It does not have
any user interface to see other users in sharing session nor it
consumes any traffic to get that data. Thus it is useful if you
want only to broadcast your location to other users in real time.
